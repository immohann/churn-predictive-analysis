## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a tool that predicts which customers are likely to leave a company based on their behavior, such as purchase history, customer service interactions, and demographic data. This information could be used to proactively address customer concerns and reduce churn. Optimizing the supply chain can significantly impact a company's bottom line, reducing costs and improving overall performance. By using data to make informed decisions about supply chain management, companies can improve customer satisfaction, reduce waste and improve their environmental sustainability. 

### Why this problem? 
- Relevance to many industries
- Develop recommendations to make better decisions and improve their operations.

## Data used

For our project, we plan to use the "Mining Company's Global Supply Chain Logistics Data for a Medium-Size Excavator - Extended Dataset" which is available at Table 1: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/8gx2fvg2k6/1. The table 1 dataset contains 1.8M rows and 53 columns. The data is in tabular form and includes both numerical and categorical variables. The features include order date, lead time, transportation cost, inventory level, supplier information, and order quantity. 
Weâ€™re considering to include a Table 2, that associates the weather information related to the location of order origin and destination. We plan to combine both the datasets to see if weather plays a major role in the delivery.  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2. 
We will need to preprocess the data, including dealing with missing values and encoding categorical variables, before using it for our analysis.

Here are the columns for the data used:

## EDA x Feature Engineering

We clea the data, and perform EDA to find corr between the columns, here are the conclusions made from the resulst.

Columns that are similar with same values but with different metadata (duplicate columns)
- [Benefit per order], Order Profit per order
- [Sales per customer], Sales, Order Item Total
- [Category ID], Product Category ID, Order Customer ID, Order Item Category ID, Product card ID,
- [Order Item Product Price],Product Price

Unwanted features(null or less correlated values)
- Product Description
- Product Status

## Machine Learning Models 

We use DecisionTreeRegressor to predict the delivery delay: 
- Target features : Days for shipping (real), Days for shipment (scheduled)
- Problem type : Multi-output Regression
